# neumorphism-experiments
This repo contains an implementation of **neumorphic design** in **Sass**.
While looking for design ideas for my personal website, I stumbled upon the new trend of **neumorphic design**. In short, it tries to mimic the real world aesthetic and light behaviour of 'cards' stacked on top of eachother, and not as pieces of paper floating around (as is the case with Material Design).

Basically, this is done using a light shadow towards the light and a dark shadow opposite to it. Usually this is coupled with way less contrast between elements. Obviously the biggest challenge is providing accessability in this low-contrast environment.

Feel free to use the code in this repo, and please contribute as well if you feel like your take would help.
